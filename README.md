# DNA-Sequence-Classification
<h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence â€“ the order of nucleotides in DNA. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery




<h3>K-mer</h3>
In bioinformatics, k-mers are subsequences of length k contained within a biological sequence. Primarily used within the context of computational genomics and sequence analysis, in which k-mers are composed of nucleotides (i.e. A, T, G, and C), k-mers are capitalized upon to assemble DNA sequences, improve heterologous gene expression, identify species in metagenomic samples








<h3>CONCLUSION:</h3>


The model seems to perform well on human data. It also does on Chimpanzee. That might not be a surprize since the chimp and human are so similar genetically. The performance on dog is not quite as good. We would expect this since the dog is more divergent from human than the chimpanze.
